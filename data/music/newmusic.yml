    description : When Monteverdi defined his new, expressive style of solo vocal writing as *seconda prattica*, as opposed to the conventional polyphonic style of *prima prattica*, he wrote a few pieces in both styles, just to say, ha! I thought this was pretty cool. So when I wrote *Hold Me Now* as the ultimate expression of the style of [the Infinite Orchestra](http://infiniteorchestra.com/hear.html), I wrote a choral version too. *Hold Me Now* is inspired by the Hafiz poem [Daniel Ladinsky wonderfully translated](https://www.amazon.com/Gift-Hafiz/dp/0140195815) as *There Could Be Holy Fallout*. And the choral version uses the text more literally.
