<i>High and Dry</i> is not the most musically sophisticated of Radiohead’s songs.  Since Thom Yorke wrote it in college, and it was recorded <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_and_Dry">during the sessions for Pablo Honey</a>, this should not be surprising.  But there is much to be said for a simple song that simply works, where everything just fits and nothing is out of place - letting Thom’s voice shine through.  Let us look at what makes this unassuming song so peaceful and satisfying.
 
The song starts small.  First, there is a beat. Then we meet our one and only chord progression, <code>F#m A E</code>.  Over that occurs a guitar riff that uses just three notes - G#-F#, then G#-E, then, simply E:

G# F#		G# E		E		<+ audio>
F#m		A		E

A melody that descends tends to imply a sense of peace and relaxation.  The riff descends, and the verse, too, is simply a set of two descending phrases that repeats:

E C# B A B	EC#BA		G#		E C# B A B	EC#BA		G# E		<+ audio>
F#m		A		E		F#m		A		E

Each phrase of the verse kicks off with a burst of energy on a dramatic high E that’s gently dissonant over the F# minor chord, but that energy quickly melts as the melody descends into relative consonance.  In the second bar, that E is repeated over an A chord, where it is now consonant.  That doesn’t fully release the tension, but by the third bar, the tune resolves from A to G# over the E chord.  This is what theorists call a 4-3 resolution, the same highly peaceful formula often used for the word “Amen”:

(Amen audio sample)

The second phrase repeats the first phrase before ending on a new note, a low E.  The low E creates an even more complete sense of resolution - it completes the octave with the high E that started the verse, and it’s a descent to the first scale degree on the tonic chord of the song.  The song could end right there!  Note, though, that on the way down, Thom artfully skipped F#, and we won’t feel full resolution until we’ve heard that note.  In fact, F# never does occur in the tune, but each time it’s skipped during the riff, verse, or chorus, we hear it in the root of the following chord.  Thus each resolution also creates momentum that propels us onward.

The chorus provides the song’s highest point of drama, as a chorus should.  On the words “Don’t leave me high,” it swiftly ascends G#-A-B before leaping to the high G#:

G# A B		G#		G# A B		G# F# 		E G# A B	G#		G# A G#	E
E		F#m		A		E		E		F#m		A		E
<+ audio>

That G# sits a ninth above the F#mi chord, an interval more dissonant than the seventh that began the verse.  And while the verse touched on and immediately left its dissonant high E, the chorus’ G# is sustained.  The dissonance doesn’t resolve for two bars, until the G# recurs on the word “dry” over an E chord where it can be consonant.  So much energy has been built up by this dramatic leap that we need a second resolution, a very classical 3-2-1 on G#-F#-E.  Finally, the end of the chorus resolves with the same low A-G#-E that ended the verse.  (The dissonant G# also conveniently fills in a gap left by the <code>F#m-A-E</code> chord progression.)

The chorus complements the verse and riff in several ways.  The verse goes down; the chorus goes up.  The verse spans the octave from E to E, and the chorus spans the octave from G# to G#, ultimately dropping down to and ending on the same low E that ends the verse.  Now we see how the song is built on E and G#.  The same notes happen to begin and end the opening riff.  In fact, the riff contains the same notes (G#-F#-E) that the chorus employs at the top of its range.  In an extra bit of symmetry, the chorus balances its three consecutive high notes with three consecutive low notes (G#-A-B); the low E that connects it to the verse completes it.

No melody so far has used the pitch D#, and every phrase of the verse has skipped D# as it descends E-C#-B.  These repeated skips create a need for D#, an opportunity for a pleasing moment in which the long-withheld pitch is meaningfully deployed.  Now look at the guitar solo:
 
E E D# E | E D# E | E D# E F# E D# … (+ audio)
 
It pounds home the D# by repeating it and repeatedly resolving it to E.  Note that the solo also includes the F# that the voice also skipped.  Thus the guitar complements the voice.
 
And thus this song contains enough tension to give the song some energy, but in a relaxing context in which every tension gets released; every expectation is ultimately gently fulfilled.  Coupled with the lyrics, this creates a satisfying sense of introversion and resignation.  Thom Yorke has said this song is <a href="http://www.followmearound.com/high_and_dry.php">“f---ing dreadful”</a>. Might we urge him to reconsider?
