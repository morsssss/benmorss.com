### Making a landing page
* Take a layout from main page layouts... skills seems as promising as any. Just simplify that down to a two-column layout where one side has a photo and a player embed, and the other has text.
* Put that in an html page like layouts/_default/article.html. Seems like that manages to include the navigation, head partials etc as defined by other HTML files in that dir.
* Make a markdown file in a place like content/music, just like we have content/blog. I'm not sure how to tell that which layout to use.
