**How I Was Radicalized**, also known as **1999**, is sleeping... but not for long.

A rock musical (is there any other kind?) about young activists driving across the country to a rally in Washington, D.C.. It’s the kind of long, arduous trip that can transform people, like Ella, the daughter of a CEO, Zack, the working-class guy in his 30s who decides to get on the bus just one more time, and Mick Mucus, the charismatic and dangerous one. The show included bookwriters **Andrea Lepcio** and **Les Hunter**. It was workshopped at [Millikin University](https://millikin.edu/) and at [Theatre 167](http://www.theatre167.org/). Many memorable scenes were created and wonderful songs were sung, but ultimately it didn’t seem satisfying on stage.

Doesn’t our world need this show now? I can’t wait for the chance to try this one again. Maybe it should return to its original *A Chorus Line*-like concept, with as little story as possible, and just showing how an idealist can break from society to fight for what they believe in.
