What if the universe was a grand machine that ran on principles drawn from computer programming? What if Steve Jobs was created in a plane of existence where everything was perfect and orderly - an efficient, bug-free system - only to be thrust into an imperfect world? What if he gradually rediscovered this beautiful universal machine and tried to recreate it on Earth?
 
Now, what if all of that was set to music?

"Steve Jobs and the Fundamental Nature of the Universe" is an experience that immerses the audience in a world of magical machines and tech. It fictionalizes one man's obsessions with beauty and computers, and it surrounds you with the wonders of technology - and the dangers.

After a sold-out reading at Luna Stage in September 2019, Iâ€™m working with collaborators to prepare this piece for a bigger reading. Stay tuned!
